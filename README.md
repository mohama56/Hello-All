🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at Cornell University (SC Johnsonson School of Business). My focus is on leveraging my resources to build repeatable-use products that drive efficiency and innovation.

💼 Previously, I worked as a Quality Analyst II, where I specialized in leading and analyzing manufacturing processes. I hold certifications in these areas, but I've chosen to pivot towards advancing my coding skills.

📊 My studies are primarily focused on finance analytics, and I’m passionate about integrating data-driven insights into business strategies.

🤝 I love connecting with people to explore growth opportunities and collaborate on impactful projects.
